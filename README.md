# Learn Redux
1. Install redux and react redux in a react app
2. Setup a simple application to use redux
3. Set actions and dispatch for redux cart
4. Create Cart Reducers
5. Create store use react redux provider
6. Connect component with redux state and actions
7. Use redux state and redux actions from a child component
8. Use redux to read dynamic state

## Data Flow
1. Action is a plain object  describing what happened
2. Call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app
3. Store calls the reducer function you gave for the given action
4. In root reducer you may combine multiple reducers into a single state tree
5. Store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer

| Presentational Components | Container Components |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- |
| How things look() | How things work() | - purpose
| No | Yes | - aware of redux
| Read data from props | Subscribe to Redux state | - to read data
| Invoke callbacks from props | Dispatch Redux actions | - To change data
| Written by hand | Usually generated by React Redux | - are written

## Basic Building Block
_Store - Action - Dispatch - Reducer_

<!-- redux coding -->
```js
//npm i redux 
//npm i react-redux - for react app

//import redux
const redux = require("redux");
//console.log(redux);

//State
const initState = { num: 0}

//Reducer - reducer can change to store
const rootReducer = (state = initState, action) => {
    //Dispatcing action 1
    if(action.type === 'INC_NUM'){
        return {
            ...state,
            num: state.num + 1
        }
    }
    //Dispatcing action 2
    if(action.type === 'ADD_NUM'){
        return {
            ...state,
            num: state.num + action.value
        }
    }
        //Dispatcing action 3
        if(action.type === 'DEC_NUM'){
            return {
                ...state,
                num: state.num - 5
            }
        }
    return state;
}

//Store
const store = redux.createStore(rootReducer);
console.log(store.getState()); //0

//Subscribe
store.subscribe(() => { //automatically perform
    console.log("[Subscribe]", store.getState());
})

//3 Dispatcing action
store.dispatch({
    type: 'INC_NUM'
})

store.dispatch({
    type: 'ADD_NUM',
    value: 34
})

store.dispatch({
    type: 'DEC_NUM'
})

//console.log(store.getState()); //manually perform
